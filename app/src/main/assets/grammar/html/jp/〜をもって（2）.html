<h1>〜をもって</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜を手段としてある行為をする。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar pattern `〜をもって` (o motte) has two primary meanings, both carrying a formal tone:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Means/Method/Instrument:</strong> Indicates the tool, method, basis, or manner by which an action is performed. It translates to "with," "by means of," "using," or "based on." It's a formal equivalent of the particle `で`.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Limit/End Point:</strong> Marks a specific point in time as a boundary, conclusion, or effective date. It translates to "as of," "at," "effective from," or "with (this point in time)."</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases, `〜をもって` adds formality compared to more common expressions. The form `〜をもちまして` (o mochimashite) is often used in highly formal situations, particularly for the time limit meaning, to increase politeness.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>`〜をもって` is frequently encountered in formal settings such as official announcements, ceremonies, business documents, written reports, and formal speeches. It's generally not used in casual conversation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When indicating means, it follows a noun representing the means, method, or basis (e.g., 技術をもって - using technology, 誠意をもって - with sincerity).</li>
    <li>When indicating a time limit, it follows a noun representing a specific date or time (e.g., 本日をもって - as of today, 3月31日をもって - as of March 31st) or a demonstrative like `これ` (kore - this) to signify the conclusion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">(Means) 全力を挙げて対応する決意をここに表明いたします。誠意をもって問題解決にあたる所存です。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">We hereby declare our resolve to respond with all our might. We intend to address the resolution of this issue with sincerity.</p>
    <p class="context">A formal statement, perhaps in a press conference or official letter, indicating the manner (sincerity) in which they will act.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">

    <p class="context">Discussing potential outcomes using a specific method (latest technology) in a formal or technical context.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">(Time Limit) これをもちまして、本日の会議を終了させていただきます。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">With this, we shall conclude today's meeting.</p>
    <p class="context">A standard, formal phrase used to end a meeting or event, often spoken by the chairperson.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">(Time Limit) 当サービスは、2024年12月31日をもって終了いたします。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">This service will be terminated as of December 31st, 2024.</p>

</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Particle `で` (de - Means):</strong> The everyday particle for indicating means, tools, or methods (e.g., `バスで` - by bus, `ペンで` - with a pen). `〜をもって` is significantly more formal and often used for more abstract means or in official contexts.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Particle `に` (ni - Time):</strong> Indicates a specific point in time (e.g., `５時に` - at 5 o'clock). `〜をもって` marks a time as a formal boundary or end point ("as of," "effective from") and is used in announcements or official contexts.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>〜によって (ni yotte - Means/Cause):</strong> Can indicate means, cause, or agent ("by," "due to," "according to"). While overlapping with the "means" sense of `〜をもって`, `〜をもって` often emphasizes the *instrument* or *method* being actively employed, whereas `〜によって` can have a broader range, including cause or basis.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The time limit meaning of `〜をもって` (especially `〜をもちまして`) is extremely common in formal closings and announcements in Japan (e.g., store closings, event endings). Recognizing this usage is important for understanding official communications. Using `〜をもって` correctly requires understanding its formal register; avoid it in casual settings where `で` or `に` would be appropriate.</p>
