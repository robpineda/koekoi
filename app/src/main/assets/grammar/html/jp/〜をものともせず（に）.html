<h1>〜をものともせず（に）</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>普通なら〜という障害に気持ちが負けてしまうのに、それを乗り越えて行動する。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>「〜をものともせず（に）」(o mono tomo sezu (ni)) means "making light of ~," "defying ~," "undaunted by ~," or "in spite of ~." It emphasizes that someone performs an action bravely or determinedly, overcoming or ignoring a significant obstacle, difficulty, or adverse condition (~) that would normally discourage or stop others. It conveys a sense of resilience, courage, determination, and a refusal to be defeated by challenges. The speaker often expresses admiration for the subject's actions. The 「に」 at the end is optional and doesn't significantly change the meaning.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This expression is often used in narrative writing, biographical accounts, news reports, or speeches to praise someone's fortitude. It typically describes overcoming significant challenges like harsh weather, physical disabilities, strong opposition, danger, or criticism. It attaches to a noun or noun phrase representing the obstacle. The structure is `Obstacle (Noun) + をものともせず（に） + [Action taken]`. It's generally not used for everyday minor inconveniences and carries a somewhat literary or elevated tone.</p>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜にもかかわらず (ni mo kakawarazu):</strong> Means "despite" or "in spite of." This is a more general term for indicating contrast between a condition and an outcome. While it can be used for obstacles, 「〜をものともせず」 specifically emphasizes the *courage* or *determination* in overcoming the obstacle, implying the obstacle is significant and normally daunting. 「〜にもかかわらず」 is more neutral.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜を顧みず (o kaerimizu):</strong> Means "without regard for ~" or "heedless of ~." Often used for risks or consequences (e.g., 危険を顧みず - heedless of the danger). It's similar to 「〜をものともせず」 when the obstacle is danger, but 「〜をものともせず」 can apply to a wider range of difficulties (criticism, disability, bad weather) and strongly emphasizes the positive trait of resilience.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜に負けずに (ni makezu ni):</strong> Means "without succumbing to ~" or "not losing to ~." It expresses perseverance against something negative (e.g., 病気に負けずに - without succumbing to illness). It's similar but perhaps slightly less dramatic than 「〜をものともせず」, which often implies overcoming something actively defied.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This expression is often used to highlight admirable qualities like bravery, perseverance, and strength of spirit in the face of adversity. It elevates the description of the action, framing it as particularly praiseworthy because of the difficulty involved. It's a powerful tool in storytelling and reporting to emphasize resilience.</p>
