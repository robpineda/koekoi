<h1>〜て（は）いられない</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>時間的・精神的に余裕がなくて、〜の状態でいることはできない。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar point "〜て（は）いられない" (te (wa) irarenai) signifies that one "cannot afford to be doing ~" or "cannot remain in the state of doing ~." It expresses an inability or unwillingness to continue an action or state due to lack of time, lack of mental composure, impatience, urgency, or strong emotions.</p>
<p>The core idea is that circumstances (internal or external) compel the person to stop the current action/state or prevent them from continuing it passively. It often implies that some other action needs to be taken instead. The optional particle `は` (wa) adds emphasis to the action/state being negated.</p>
<p>It conveys feelings like impatience ("I can't just stand here waiting!"), urgency ("There's no time to be doing this!"), or strong emotional reaction ("I can't just sit by laughing!").</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This expression is common in both spoken and written Japanese and is used across various levels of formality, though it's perhaps most frequent in situations expressing personal feelings or immediate reactions.</p>
<p>It is typically used when someone feels pressure to act or change their current state. The structure is `Verb (て-form) + (は) + いられない`.</p>
<p>Common scenarios include realizing one is late, witnessing something that demands a reaction, or feeling overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">もう締め切りが近いから、のんびりしてはいられない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">The deadline is already close, so I can't afford to be taking it easy.</p>
    <p class="context">Expressing the urgency to work due to an approaching deadline.</p>

    <p class="original-sentence">火事だと聞いたら、心配でじっとしてはいられなかった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">When I heard there was a fire, I was so worried I couldn't just stay still.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing an inability to remain passive due to anxiety or concern.</p>

    <p class="context">Using the structure in a double negative to strongly affirm the inability *not* to do something (laughing).</p>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜している場合ではない (shite iru baai dewa nai):</strong> Means "it's not the time/situation for doing ~." This focuses more objectively on the inappropriateness of the action given the circumstances, whereas `〜てはいられない` emphasizes the speaker's internal feeling of impatience or inability to endure the state.</p>
<p><strong>〜我慢できない (gaman dekinai):</strong> Means "cannot endure/stand/tolerate ~." This specifically relates to lack of patience or tolerance for something unpleasant. `〜てはいられない` is broader and can relate to time constraints or urgency as well.</p>
<p><strong>〜（する）わけにはいかない ((suru) wake ni wa ikanai):</strong> Means "cannot possibly do ~" often due to social/logical reasons. This focuses on the impossibility or inappropriateness of *starting* or *doing* an action, while `〜てはいられない` focuses on the inability to *continue* an action or state.</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This is a very common and useful expression for conveying a sense of urgency or strong feeling that prevents one from remaining passive or continuing a current activity.</p>
<p>Remember it's formed with the `て-form` of the verb. The negative potential `〜いられない` comes from the potential form of いる (to be), which is いられる (to be able to be), negated.</p>
<p>The nuance often implies that the speaker immediately stopped the action or state mentioned, or is about to.</p>
