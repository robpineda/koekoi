<h1>〜や、〜や否や (〜や、いなや)</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜とほとんど同時に次のことが起こる。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This indicates that one event (〜) is followed almost instantly by another, with virtually no gap between them. It’s a formal, literary expression that underscores simultaneity and inevitability. "や" alone is slightly less emphatic than "や否や," which adds a sense of "no sooner than." The verb before 〜や is in dictionary form.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>Common in written Japanese (e.g., novels, essays) or formal speech, it’s not typical in casual settings. It’s often used to describe instinctive or automatic reactions.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼を見るや、彼女は顔を赤らめて目をそらした。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">The moment she saw him, she blushed and looked away.</p>
    <p class="context">A shy, immediate emotional response in a romantic scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">電車が駅に着くや否や、乗客が一斉に降り始めた。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">No sooner had the train arrived at the station than passengers began disembarking all at once.</p>
    <p class="context">A busy, coordinated reaction in a public setting.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">電話が鳴るや、母は急いで受話器を取った。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">As soon as the phone rang, my mother hurriedly picked it up.</p>
    <p class="context">A quick, habitual response to an everyday event.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>〜が早いか: Less formal than 〜や否や and focuses on speed rather than near-simultaneity.</p>
<p>〜途端に (とたんに): Similar timing, but 〜途端に often implies an unexpected or negative outcome, while 〜や/や否や is neutral.</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The formality of this structure ties to Japan’s tradition of precise, elegant expression in writing. For JLPT N1, it’s key to distinguish its tone from more casual alternatives in reading comprehension.</p>
