<h1>〜といい…といい</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜を見ても…を見ても同じような状態だ。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The pattern 「Aといい Bといい」 is used to pick out two or more representative examples (A and B) to illustrate that a certain quality, state, or evaluation applies to the subject as a whole, based on these examples. It translates roughly to "looking at A, and looking at B..." or "both A and B...". It implies that A and B are typical examples and that the speaker's assessment (often subjective, like praise, criticism, or observation) holds true generally for the thing being described. It frequently carries a nuance of admiration, surprise, dissatisfaction, or emphasis on a particular characteristic evident in both examples.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>「〜といい…といい」 is used when evaluating or commenting on something by highlighting specific aspects. A and B are typically nouns or noun phrases that are parts or characteristics of the subject being discussed. The structure is usually `Noun A + といい + Noun B + といい, [Evaluation/Comment]`. It can be used in both spoken and written Japanese, often adding a touch of emphasis or emotional coloring (positive or negative) to the statement.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">このレストランは、味といいサービスといい、本当に素晴らしい。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">This restaurant, both in terms of its taste and its service, is truly wonderful.</p>
    <p class="context">Praising a restaurant by highlighting two key positive aspects.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼のアパートは、広さといい、日当たりの良さといい、申し分ない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">His apartment, in terms of its size and its good sunlight exposure, is perfect (leaves nothing to be desired).</p>
    <p class="context">Describing the positive qualities of an apartment using specific examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">あの選手は、スピードといい、テクニックといい、将来が期待される。</p>

    <p class="context">Evaluating an athlete's potential based on two notable skills.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜も〜も:</strong> Simply lists two items that share a characteristic, but without the strong nuance of them being representative examples for an overall evaluation. Example: 「味もサービスも良い。」(The taste and the service are good.) - Less emphatic than 「〜といい〜といい」. <br>
    <strong>〜だけでなく〜も / 〜はもちろん〜も:</strong> Means "not only A but also B." It emphasizes the addition of B to A, rather than using A and B as parallel examples for a general assessment. Example: 「味だけでなくサービスも素晴らしい。」 (Not only the taste but also the service is wonderful.)<br>
    <strong>〜とか〜とか / 〜やら〜やら:</strong> Lists examples, often non-exhaustively or implying variety/disorder, rather than highlighting specific points for evaluation like 「〜といい〜といい」.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>「〜といい…といい」 is a useful structure for making evaluations or expressing impressions by citing specific evidence. The choice of A and B should be relevant examples supporting the overall comment. While often used for positive evaluations, it can also be used for negative ones (e.g., 「値段といい、品質といい、がっかりだ。」 - "Both the price and the quality are disappointing."). It adds a slightly more expressive or subjective flavor compared to simply listing characteristics.</p>
