<h1>〜にして</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜という高い段階・特別な条件に合っている・合っていない。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>「〜にして (ni shite)」 is a versatile grammar pattern with several meanings, but based on the provided explanation (〜という高い段階・特別な条件 - high stage/special condition), this focuses on the meaning: **"only because it is X," "precisely at time/level X," or "even X (who is at a high level)."** It often highlights that something is possible or impossible only due to the specific nature, high level, special condition, or specific timing of the noun preceding it. It can imply admiration, surprise, or difficulty.</p>
<p>Other meanings of 「〜にして」 exist (e.g., indicating simultaneous roles, sudden change), but this explanation points towards emphasizing a specific condition or level.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This particular usage of 「〜にして」 typically follows a noun or noun phrase representing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A high level or status (e.g., プロ - pro, 経験者 - experienced person)</li>
    <li>A specific age or time (e.g., この年 - this age, この段階 - this stage)</li>
    <li>A special condition or entity (e.g., 彼 - he/him, 名人 - master)</li>
</ul>
<p>It often implies that the action described is remarkable or noteworthy given the preceding noun. It's generally used in more formal written or spoken Japanese.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">この難問を解けるのは、名人にして初めて可能だろう。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Solving this difficult problem would likely only be possible for a master (lit: only being a master makes it possible for the first time).</p>
    <p class="context">Emphasizing that only someone at the highest level (master) could achieve this.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼は若干20歳にして、すでに会社の重要なプロジェクトを任されている。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">At the young age of only 20, he has already been entrusted with an important company project.</p>
    <p class="context">Highlighting the remarkable achievement given his young age (special condition).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">百戦錬磨の彼にして、今回の交渉は困難を極めた。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Even for him, a veteran of countless battles (negotiations), this negotiation proved extremely difficult.</p>
    <p class="context">Showing the extreme difficulty by noting that even a highly experienced person (high level) struggled.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜でさえ / 〜ですら (de sae / de sura):</strong> These mean "even X" and can sometimes overlap, especially when highlighting a high-level person struggling (e.g., 「名人ですら解けない」 - even a master cannot solve it). However, 「〜にして」 often carries a stronger nuance of "only at this level/condition is it possible/remarkable," rather than just presenting an extreme example.</p>
<p><strong>〜になってはじめて (ni natte hajimete):</strong> Means "only after becoming/reaching X." This focuses specifically on the point in time or development when something becomes possible, whereas 「〜にして」 can refer to a static condition or level itself. Example: 「名人になってはじめて解ける」 (Only after becoming a master can one solve it) vs 「名人にして初めて可能だ」 (Being a master is what makes it possible for the first time).</p>
<p><strong>Particle で (de):</strong> Sometimes simple particle usage can convey a related meaning, but 「〜にして」 adds more emphasis on the specific level or condition. Example: 「プロで失敗する」(A pro fails) vs 「プロにして失敗する」(Even a pro fails / For a pro, failing is significant).</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This usage of 「〜にして」 adds a layer of formality and emphasis. It's often used to express admiration for someone achieving something at a certain stage, or surprise that even someone at a high level faces difficulty. Understanding the context is crucial as 「〜にして」 has other meanings. This specific nuance is common in formal writing and speeches.</p>
