<h1>〜をもって</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜の時までで、ある行事やそれまで続いていたことを終わりにする、と宣言する。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This expression, in the context of time, means "as of," "at," or "with (this point in time)," and is used to formally declare the conclusion or termination of an event, service, or ongoing state. It marks a specific point in time (the noun preceding 「をもって」) as the moment when something officially ends. It carries a strong sense of formality and finality, often used in official announcements, ceremonies, or formal declarations. Compared to similar expressions, it can sound more definitive and official.</p>
<p>Note: 「をもって」 has other meanings, such as "by means of" or "using" (e.g., 実力をもって解決する - solve by means of ability), but this explanation focuses specifically on its use to indicate an end time.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>「〜をもって」 is primarily used in formal written or spoken announcements. It typically follows a noun indicating a specific point in time (like 本日 - this day, 今回 - this time, 最終日 - the last day, a specific date). It is frequently seen in closing announcements for events, termination of services, end of application periods, or formal farewells. The structure is: [Time Noun/Event] + をもって、[Sentence stating the conclusion/termination]. Due to its formality, it's less common in casual conversation.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">これをもちまして、閉会式を終了いたします。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">With this, we hereby conclude the closing ceremony.</p>
    <p class="context">A formal announcement marking the very end of a ceremony.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">当店は、本日をもって閉店することになりました。長年のご愛顧、誠にありがとうございました。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Our store will be closing as of today. Thank you very much for your loyal patronage over the years.</p>
    <p class="context">A formal notice announcing the final day of business for a store.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">応募受付は、9月30日（金）17時をもって締め切らせていただきます。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">The application acceptance period will be closed at 5:00 PM on Friday, September 30th.</p>
    <p class="context">An official announcement stating the precise deadline for applications.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜を限りに:</strong> Very similar in meaning when indicating an end time, also marking a cutoff point for something continuous. 「〜をもって」 can sometimes feel slightly more formal or "official announcement" oriented than 「〜を限りに」. For example, 「本日をもって」 is very common in official closing statements, perhaps more so than 「本日を限りに」 in that specific context, though both are grammatically correct. 「〜を限りに」 might sometimes place a bit more emphasis on it being the *last* instance or based on a personal resolution.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜で:</strong> Can indicate a time or point of conclusion, but lacks the formality and declarative nuance of 「〜をもって」. Example: 受付は５時で終了です (Reception closes at 5 PM) - a simple statement of fact.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜次第:</strong> Used for "as soon as," indicating something will happen immediately after something else finishes, not marking the end itself. Example: 会議が終わり次第、連絡します (I'll contact you as soon as the meeting ends).
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The formality of 「〜をもって」 makes it a staple in official Japanese communication regarding endings and deadlines. Its use signals a clear, non-negotiable conclusion. Understanding this nuance is important when reading official documents, notices, or listening to formal speeches in Japan. Remember that this is just one meaning of 「をもって」; context is key to distinguishing it from the "by means of" meaning.</p>
