<h1>〜手前</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜という立場・人物を意識するから、そうしないと評価が下がってしまう・面目が立たない。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>`〜手前` (てまえ) expresses that because of one's position, reputation, social standing, or a promise/statement previously made, one feels obligated to act in a certain way to avoid losing face, damaging their reputation, or appearing inconsistent. It translates to "because of (my/his/her) position...", "in consideration of...", "given that (I/he/she said/did)...", often implying a sense of social obligation or pressure to maintain appearances. The key nuance is the concern for external evaluation or maintaining one's public image/credibility.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This pattern is used when explaining the reason for an action (or inaction) that is motivated by maintaining face, fulfilling expectations associated with a role, or upholding a previous commitment or statement. It is often used in situations where there's a potential conflict between personal desire and social/reputational obligation. It typically follows a noun, a noun phrase + `の`, or a verb phrase (often past tense `た` form) describing the position, previous statement, or situation that creates the obligation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Noun + (の) + 手前</li>
    <li>Verb (plain past た form) + 手前</li>
    <li>Verb (ている form) + 手前</li>
</ul>
<p>The clause following `〜手前` states the action taken (or avoided) due to this sense of obligation.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">皆の前で「やります」と言った手前、今さらやめるわけにはいかない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Having said "I'll do it" in front of everyone, I can't possibly quit now (as I would lose face).</p>
    <p class="context">Explaining the obligation to continue with a task because a public commitment was made.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">部長の手前、この提案に反対するとは言えなかった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">In consideration of the department head('s presence/position), I couldn't say I opposed this proposal.</p>
    <p class="context">Explaining why someone didn't voice opposition, implying it was due to the boss's authority or presence and the desire not to cause issues or seem disrespectful.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">いつも偉そうなことを言っている手前、簡単なミスはできない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Given that I'm always saying boastful/authoritative things, I can't make simple mistakes.</p>
    <p class="context">Feeling pressure to perform perfectly because one has cultivated an image of being highly competent or knowledgeable.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜から / 〜ので:</strong> These indicate general reasons without the specific nuance of social obligation or concern for reputation/face.</li>
    <li><strong>〜以上（は）:</strong> ("Now that...", "Since...") Expresses a strong sense of determination or obligation arising from a certain situation or decision, but often focuses more on logical consequence or resolve rather than specifically on saving face.</li>
    <li><strong>〜面目がある / ない:</strong> (めんぼくがある/ない - "to have/lose face") This phrase directly talks about face, but `〜手前` functions as a conjunction explaining the *reason* (related to face/position) *why* an action is taken.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The concept of "face" (面目 menboku, 体面 taimen) is important in Japanese culture, and `〜手前` directly relates to this. It reflects the awareness of how one is perceived by others based on their role, commitments, and actions. Using `〜手前` acknowledges that social standing or prior declarations create constraints or obligations on behavior. It often implies a slight burden or lack of freedom due to these external factors. While it can sound slightly formal, it's understood in many conversational contexts when explaining motivations tied to reputation or position.</p>
