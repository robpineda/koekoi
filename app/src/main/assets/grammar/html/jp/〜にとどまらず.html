<h1>〜にとどまらず</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜の範囲に収まらないで、もっと広く及ぶ。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar point `〜にとどまらず` (ni todomarazu) means "not limited to X," "not stopping at X," "extending beyond X," or "not only X, but also..." It indicates that something (an influence, effect, scope, range, activity, etc.) is not confined to the boundary or category mentioned before it, but extends further to a wider area, group, or level. It emphasizes expansion and scope exceeding a certain initial point. The nuance is that the initial scope (X) is already significant or expected, but the reality is even broader. It comes from the verb `留まる` (todomaru), meaning "to stop" or "to remain," used in its negative continuous form.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>`〜にとどまらず` follows a noun or a noun phrase, which represents the initial or limited scope. The sentence then typically continues to describe the wider scope or extent. It is often used in formal writing, news reports, presentations, and academic contexts to describe trends, influences, impacts, or ranges that affect multiple areas or groups. Common patterns include "Noun + にとどまらず、 + Wider Scope + も/まで + Verb/Adjective." (e.g., Not limited to A, but also affecting/reaching B).</p>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜だけでなく〜も (dake de naku...mo):</strong> Means "not only X, but also Y." This is a very common and versatile structure with a similar meaning. `〜にとどまらず` often implies a more natural expansion or influence spreading outwards from X, whereas `〜だけでなく` simply lists two or more items/scopes. `〜にとどまらず` can feel slightly more formal or literary.</li>
    <li><strong>〜ばかりでなく〜も (bakari de naku...mo):</strong> Also means "not only X, but also Y," very similar to `〜だけでなく`. Perhaps slightly more emphatic than `〜だけでなく`. Again, `〜にとどまらず` emphasizes the exceeding of a boundary or limit.</li>
    <li><strong>〜はもちろん〜も (wa mochiron...mo):</strong> Means "X is obvious/of course, but also Y." This structure assumes X is expected and emphasizes the inclusion of Y. `〜にとどまらず` focuses more on the expansion beyond X itself. (See `〜はおろか` for a related structure).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This grammar point is useful for describing phenomena that have a wide-ranging impact, such as globalization, the spread of technology, or the influence of cultural trends. It helps to frame an issue as having broader significance than might initially appear. Pay attention to the particle `に`; it attaches directly to the noun representing the initial scope.</p>
