<h1>〜（よ）うと〜まいと・〜（よ）うが〜まいが</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜しても〜しなくても、どちらでも関係ない・影響されない。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This grammar pattern explicitly contrasts two opposing possibilities: doing an action (indicated by the volitional form `〜（よ）う`) versus not doing it (indicated by the negative volitional form `〜まい`). It strongly asserts that the outcome stated in the main clause remains exactly the same regardless of which of these two possibilities occurs. The core meaning is "whether one does X or does not do X, it doesn't matter / it has no effect." It conveys a strong sense of indifference, emphasizes that a choice is irrelevant, or states a fixed result/rule.</p>
<p>`〜（よ）うと〜まいと` and `〜（よ）うが〜まいが` are virtually interchangeable in meaning. `〜が〜まいが` might sometimes feel slightly more direct or common in speech compared to the `〜と〜まいと` version, which can have a slightly more literary feel.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This structure is used when the speaker wants to forcefully state that a specific action or choice has no bearing on the situation or outcome described in the main clause. It's common in contexts expressing determination ("I'll do it whether you approve or not"), stating strict rules ("Payment is due whether you attend or not"), or showing clear indifference ("Whether he comes or not, it makes no difference to me").</p>
<p>Structure: Verb (volitional form) + と/が + Verb (negative volitional form `まい`) + と/が, [Main Clause]</p>
<p>Note: The negative volitional `〜まい` attaches differently based on verb group:
<ul>
    <li>Group 1 (u-verbs): Dictionary form + まい (e.g., 行くまい iku mai)</li>
    <li>Group 2 (ru-verbs): Dictionary form + まい OR stem + まい (e.g., 食べるまい taberu mai / 食べまい tabe mai - both possible)</li>
    <li>Group 3 (irregular): しまい (or すまい), こまい</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜ても〜なくても:</strong> This structure also conveys "whether X happens or not." However, `〜（よ）うと〜まいと / 〜（よ）うが〜まいが` generally sounds stronger, more emphatic, and potentially more formal or literary due to the use of the volitional and negative volitional forms.</p>
<p><strong>〜かどうかに関わらず / 〜かどうかにかかわらず:</strong> Means "regardless of whether or not ~." This phrasing is more neutral and descriptive compared to the emphatic and sometimes confrontational tone of `〜（よ）うと〜まいと / 〜（よ）うが〜まいが`.</p>
<p><strong>〜（よ）うと（も）・〜（よ）うが:</strong> This structure presents only one condition ("even if X happens..."). `〜（よ）うと〜まいと / 〜（よ）うが〜まいが` explicitly presents both the positive and negative possibilities (doing X vs. not doing X).</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The negative volitional form `〜まい` is not commonly used in everyday casual conversation outside of set patterns like this one. Its use here contributes to the somewhat formal or emphatic tone of the expression. This pattern is very useful for making strong statements where the irrelevance of a choice or action needs to be highlighted clearly. Because it's emphatic, use it thoughtfully in conversation.</p>
