<h1>〜べく</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜ようと思ってある行為をする。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar pattern `〜べく` (beku) expresses a strong intention, purpose, or objective for performing an action. It translates to "in order to," "with the aim of," "for the purpose of," or "so as to." It conveys a conscious effort and determination towards achieving a specific goal. The nuance is stronger and more formal than the general-purpose `〜ために` (tame ni). It often implies that the goal is significant or requires considerable effort. The subject of the verb before `〜べく` and the action verb following it must be the same. The clause following `〜べく` must describe a volitional action (an action done by will) and cannot typically be a state, passive occurrence, command, request, or suggestion.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>`〜べく` is primarily used in written language, formal speeches, news reports, or somewhat literary contexts. It is not commonly used in casual, everyday conversation. It attaches to the dictionary form (終止形 - shuushikei) of verbs. For する-verbs, it often becomes `すべく` (subeku).</p>
<p>Common Structure: [Verb (Dictionary Form)] + べく、[Action taken towards the goal]</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼は試験に合格すべく、毎日一生懸命勉強した。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">In order to pass the exam, he studied hard every day.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing someone's determined effort towards the clear goal of passing an exam.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">真相を明らかにするべく、調査チームが派遣された。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">With the aim of clarifying the truth, an investigation team was dispatched.</p>
    <p class="context">Explaining the purpose behind sending the team, often used in news or official reports.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">一日も早く復旧すべく、全力を尽くしています。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">We are doing our utmost in order to restore it as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="context">A formal statement about the dedicated effort being put towards recovery, perhaps after a disaster.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>〜ために (tame ni):</strong> The most common and versatile way to express purpose ("in order to," "for the sake of"). `〜べく` is significantly more formal and often implies a stronger resolve or a more substantial goal. `〜ために` can be used in both spoken and written Japanese.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>〜ように (you ni):</strong> Also expresses purpose ("so that," "in order that"), but often used when the outcome is not entirely controllable by the subject, or when expressing a hope, wish, or indirect command. `〜べく` implies a direct, volitional action towards a controllable outcome.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>〜（よ）うと（して） ((yo)u to (shite)):</strong> Expresses an attempt or intention ("trying to do ~," "intending to do ~"). While related to purpose, `〜べく` emphasizes the established goal *behind* the action more strongly than the *attempt* itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>Using `〜べく` adds a level of formality and seriousness to the statement. It's often associated with formal declarations of intent or explanations of significant actions. Learners should be careful not to use it in casual conversation, as it would sound unnaturally stiff or archaic. Remember the restriction: the following clause must be a volitional action undertaken by the same subject.</p>
