<h1>〜に至って・〜に至っても</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>事態が〜まで進んでやっとある状態になった・事態が〜まで進んでもある状態にならない。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This grammar pattern expresses reaching a significant, often critical or final, stage or point in a process or situation.
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜に至って (ni itatte):</strong> Means "having reached the point of X, finally Y happened". It indicates that only when the situation progressed to a certain serious or extreme level did a particular outcome or realization occur. Often implies that this happened late.</li>
    <li><strong>〜に至っても (ni itattemo):</strong> Means "even having reached the point of X, Y still hasn't happened / Y still continues". It emphasizes that despite the situation progressing to a significant stage, the expected or desired change or state has not materialized. Often conveys surprise, frustration, or highlights persistence of a condition.</li>
</ul>
Both forms often carry a nuance of seriousness, extremity, or a point of no return. The formality level is relatively high, often used in written language, news reports, or formal speeches.
</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>Used to describe situations that have developed to a notable or critical phase. It commonly follows nouns or the dictionary form of verbs.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Noun + に至って / に至っても</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Verb (Dictionary Form) + に至って / に至っても</strong></li>
</ul>
This pattern is typically used when discussing serious matters, turning points, crises, or long-awaited developments (or lack thereof). It emphasizes the significance of the stage reached. For example, discussing the point at which a government finally acts, or the point where someone finally realizes something, or even when reaching a dire stage, something *still* doesn't change.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">多くの犠牲者を出すに至って、政府はようやく重い腰を上げた。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Only after reaching the point where many victims had emerged did the government finally decide to take action.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Describing a slow government response to a disaster or crisis, emphasizing action was taken only when the situation became severe.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">この期に及ぶに至っても、彼はまだ自分の非を認めようとしない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Even having reached this late stage, he still refuses to admit his fault.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Expressing frustration about someone's stubbornness despite the situation being critical or evidence being clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">手術が必要な段階に至って、初めて彼は病気の深刻さを理解した。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">It was only upon reaching the stage where surgery was necessary that he first understood the seriousness of his illness.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Highlighting a delayed realization that occurred only when the situation progressed to a critical point.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜になって初めて (ni natte hajimete):</strong> "Only after becoming X / Only after X happened". Similar to 「〜に至って」 in indicating a late realization or action, but 「に至って」 often implies a more critical, extreme, or final stage within a process.</li>
    <li><strong>〜てようやく (te youyaku):</strong> "Finally after doing X / Finally when X happened". Indicates a long-awaited event occurred, but less formal and doesn't necessarily emphasize reaching a specific critical *stage* like 「〜に至って」.</li>
    <li><strong>〜ても (temo):</strong> The general conditional "even if/though". 「〜に至っても」 is much more specific, meaning "even after reaching *this specific significant point/stage*".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>Both forms often imply that the action or realization mentioned (in the case of 「〜に至って」) happened later than it ideally should have, or that the lack of change (in the case of 「〜に至っても」) is particularly noteworthy or problematic given the stage reached. The phrase 「この期に及んで（も）」 (kono go ni oyonde(mo)) is a common set phrase using this grammar, meaning "at this late stage (even now)".</p>
