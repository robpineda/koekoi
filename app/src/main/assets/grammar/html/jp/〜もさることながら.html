<h1>〜もさることながら</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜もそうだが、それに追加して、もっと強調したいことがある。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar point `〜もさることながら` (mo sarukoto nagara) means "X is certainly true/important, but Y (is even more so/also noteworthy)." It acknowledges the validity or importance of the first point (X) but then introduces a second point (Y) that the speaker wants to emphasize more or finds more significant. `さることながら` derives from `然る事` (sarukoto - that thing, such a thing) + `ながら` (while, although). Essentially, "while that (X) is indeed the case..." The nuance is one of concession followed by emphasis on something additional or more important. It's often used to add a further point that surpasses or complements the first one.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>`〜もさることながら` follows a noun or noun phrase (X). The sentence structure is typically "X + もさることながら、 + Y + が/は...". Point Y is presented as equally or more important/impressive/relevant than point X. This structure is common in evaluations, descriptions, and arguments where the speaker wants to acknowledge one aspect but highlight another. It tends to be used in slightly formal or written Japanese, adding a sophisticated tone when making comparisons or adding points.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">そのレストランは、味もさることながら、雰囲気も素晴らしい。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Regarding that restaurant, the taste is certainly good, but the atmosphere is also wonderful.</p>
    <p class="context">Giving a positive review, acknowledging the food quality (X) but wanting to emphasize the great atmosphere (Y) as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼女のデザインは、独創性もさることながら、実用性にも優れている。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Her designs, while certainly original, are also excellent in terms of practicality.</p>
    <p class="context">Praising a designer's work, acknowledging its creativity (X) but highlighting its usability (Y) as a key strength.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">この景色は昼間もさることながら、夜景は息をのむほどの美しさだ。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">This scenery is great during the day, certainly, but the night view is breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing a viewpoint, acknowledging the daytime view (X) but emphasizing the exceptional beauty of the night view (Y).</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜だけでなく〜も (dake de naku...mo):</strong> Means "not only X, but also Y." This is a more general structure for listing points. `〜もさることながら` specifically implies that X is already accepted as true or significant, and Y is being added as an equal or greater point of emphasis.</li>
    <li><strong>〜はもちろん〜も (wa mochiron...mo):</strong> Means "X goes without saying, but also Y." This strongly implies that X is obvious or expected. `〜もさることながら` acknowledges X but doesn't necessarily imply it's completely obvious; it just sets the stage for emphasizing Y.</li>
    <li><strong>〜に加えて (ni kuwaete):</strong> Means "in addition to X." This is a straightforward way to add information. `〜もさることながら` has a stronger nuance of acknowledging X first *before* shifting emphasis to Y.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>`〜もさることながら` is a useful conjunctive phrase for constructing balanced arguments or evaluations. It allows the speaker/writer to show they recognize one aspect (X) before highlighting what they consider an equally or more important aspect (Y). Its slightly formal tone makes it suitable for presentations, reviews, and written reports. The key is the shift in emphasis from the acknowledged X to the highlighted Y.</p>
