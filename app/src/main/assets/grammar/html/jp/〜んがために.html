<h1>〜んがため（に）</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜という目的を持ってある行為をする。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar pattern `〜んがため（に）` (n ga tame (ni)) expresses a strong sense of purpose or objective for undertaking an action, similar to `〜べく` but often with an even stronger, more literary, or sometimes archaic nuance. It translates to "for the purpose of," "in order to," "with the sole aim of," or "for the sake of." It frequently implies a significant effort, sacrifice, or a grand, potentially personal, objective. The `（に）` is often optional. It strongly emphasizes the *reason* or *motivation* behind the action, often highlighting its importance to the subject.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>`〜んがため（に）` is almost exclusively used in formal written language, literature, historical narratives, or very formal speeches. It is extremely rare in modern spoken Japanese. It attaches to the *negative stem* (未然形 - mizenkei, the stem used with `-nai`) of verbs. For Godan verbs, this is the `-a` vowel sound stem (e.g., `勝つ` -> `勝た` -> `勝たんがため`). For Ichidan verbs, just remove the final `-る` (e.g., `生きる` -> `生き` -> `生きんがため`). For する, the classical negative stem `せ` is used, becoming `せんがため`.</p>
<p>Common Structure: [Verb (Negative Stem)] + んがため（に）、[Action taken for that purpose]</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼は家族を養わんがために、遠い国へ出稼ぎに行った。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">For the sake of supporting his family, he went to a distant country to work.</p>
    <p class="context">Highlighting the strong, perhaps self-sacrificing, motivation behind his decision to work far away.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">自らの信念を貫かんがため、彼は多くの反対を押し切った。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">In order to stay true to his own beliefs, he pushed through much opposition.</p>
    <p class="context">Emphasizing the determination and purpose driving his actions against adversity, often found in biographical or narrative writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">真実を明らかにせんがため（に）、命をかけたジャーナリストもいる。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">There are journalists who have risked their lives for the purpose of revealing the truth.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing a profound and potentially dangerous objective using formal, slightly dramatic language.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>〜べく (beku):</strong> Both are formal ways to express strong purpose. `〜んがため（に）` generally feels more literary, slightly more archaic, and can carry a stronger nuance of sacrifice or a grander personal objective. The conjugation method is different (negative stem vs. dictionary form).</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>〜ために (tame ni):</strong> The standard, general-purpose way to express purpose. `〜んがため（に）` is vastly more formal, literary, and emphatic, unsuitable for everyday conversation where `〜ために` would be used.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This pattern evokes a sense of classical Japanese literature or historical drama. Its use in modern contexts is deliberate, aiming for a very formal, emphatic, or even archaic tone. Learners should primarily focus on recognizing it in written texts rather than attempting to use it in conversation. The specific negative stem conjugation (`-an`) is a key feature derived from classical grammar. The form `せんがため` (from `する`) is particularly common in set phrases or historical contexts.</p>
