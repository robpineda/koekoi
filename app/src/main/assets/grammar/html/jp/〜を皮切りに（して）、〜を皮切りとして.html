<h1>〜を皮切りに（して）、〜を皮切りとして</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜から始まって次々に何かをする。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This expression means "starting with A, then followed by B, C, and so on," indicating that the item mentioned before 「を皮切りに」 serves as the starting point for a series of similar actions or events that subsequently occur one after another. It often implies a dynamic development or expansion, frequently used for positive or large-scale happenings like the launch of a product series, the opening of chain stores, or a tour starting in one city and moving to others. The nuance is that the first event triggers or leads to the following ones in succession. Both 「〜を皮切りにして」 and 「〜を皮切りとして」 have the same meaning, with the latter potentially sounding slightly more formal or written.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This grammar point is typically used in written Japanese or slightly more formal spoken contexts, such as news reports, presentations, or descriptions of business strategies or event series. It connects a noun (often representing the first event, place, or item) to the subsequent series of developments. The pattern is: Noun + を皮切りに（して）/ を皮切りとして、 [Sentence describing subsequent events]. It's commonly used when describing the beginning of a trend, a series of releases, or sequential occurrences originating from a specific point.</p>

    <p class="en-translation">Starting with the broadcast of this anime, related merchandise was released one after another.</p>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜をはじめ（として）:</strong> Means "starting with A (as a prime example), and others." It lists a representative example followed by others of the same category, but doesn't necessarily imply a sequential or dynamic progression like 「〜を皮切りに」. Example: 日本には、富士山をはじめ、美しい山がたくさんある (Japan has many beautiful mountains, starting with Mt. Fuji).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜から:</strong> Indicates a simple starting point in time or sequence ("from A onwards"). It lacks the nuance of "triggering a subsequent series" that 「〜を皮切りに」 carries. Example: ９時から会議が始まります (The meeting starts from 9 o'clock).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜に基づいて:</strong> Means "based on A". It indicates the foundation or basis for something, not a starting point for a sequence of events. Example: 調査結果に基づいて計画を立てる (Make a plan based on the survey results).
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The word 「皮切り」(kawakiri) literally refers to the first cut made when processing leather or hides. This origin lends the expression a sense of "making the first move" which then leads to further actions. It is generally used for observable events or actions that mark the beginning of a series, rather than abstract concepts. It often carries a positive or neutral connotation of expansion or development.</p>
