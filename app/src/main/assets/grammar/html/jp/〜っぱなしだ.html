<h1>〜っぱなしだ</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>普通はないような〜という状態が続いている。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>「〜っぱなしだ (-ppanashi da)」 is used to describe a state where something has been left continuously in a certain condition, often implying negligence, incompletion, or that the state is inappropriate or undesirable. It attaches to the stem of a verb (the part before 〜ます). The core meaning is "left ~ing," "left (on/open/undone)," suggesting that an action was started and not properly finished, or that something was put into a state and left there when it should have been attended to. It often carries a nuance of complaint, criticism, or carelessness. The final 「だ」 makes the statement informal and direct.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This pattern is primarily used in informal, spoken Japanese. It's frequently used to complain about someone else's actions (or inaction) or sometimes self-critically about one's own forgetfulness or habits.
    The structure is:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Verb Stem (ます-stem) + っぱなしだ</strong></li>
</ul>
Common situations include leaving lights or appliances on, doors or windows open, tasks half-finished, or items left lying around.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">弟はいつも電気をつけっぱなしで寝る。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">My younger brother always sleeps with the light left on.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Complaining about a sibling's habit.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">ごめん、シャワー出しっぱなしだった！</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Sorry, I left the shower running!</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Realizing and apologizing for one's own carelessness.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">ドアを開けっ放しにしないでください。虫が入るから。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Please don't leave the door open. Bugs will get in.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Making a request, pointing out the negative consequence of leaving the door open.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜まま (-mama):</strong> Also indicates that something remains in a certain state. However, 「〜まま」 is often more neutral and can describe intentional states (e.g., 靴のまま入る - enter with shoes on). 「〜っぱなし」 strongly implies that the state is unintentional, negligent, or incomplete – something *should* have been done but wasn't.</li>
    <li><strong>〜ている (-te iru):</strong> Indicates a continuous state or ongoing action. It lacks the specific nuance of "being left" in that state, especially the implication of negligence or incompletion inherent in 「〜っぱなし」. For example, 「電気がついている」 (The light is on) is neutral, whereas 「電気がつけっぱなしだ」 (The light has been left on) implies someone forgot to turn it off.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This is a very common pattern in casual conversation for expressing mild annoyance or pointing out carelessness. While the original explanation mentions "a state that is not normal," it's more about a state that hasn't been resolved or tidied up as expected. The 「だ」 ending is very informal; 「〜っぱなしです」 is slightly more polite but still retains the core meaning and is generally used in informal politeness levels. Overuse can make the speaker sound critical or complaining.</p>
