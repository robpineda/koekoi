<h1>〜を限りに</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜の時までで、それまで続いていたことを終わりにする、と宣言する。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This expression means "starting from (time/date), ... will end," "as of (time/date), ... will cease," or "this is the last time for..." It indicates a clear cutoff point, marking the end of something that has continued up until that point. The nuance is that of a declaration or announcement that a continuous action, state, or practice will stop at the specified time (the noun preceding 「を限りに」). It often carries a sense of finality and sometimes regret or resolution. It's stronger than simply saying something will end; it emphasizes *this* point as the definitive limit.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>「〜を限りに」 is typically used in announcements, declarations, or statements indicating the cessation of something. The noun preceding it is almost always related to time (e.g.,今日 (today), 今月 (this month), 本日 (this day), 今回 (this time)). It's common in situations like retirement announcements, closing down businesses, ending a service, or stopping a habit. The structure is: [Time Noun] + を限りに、[Sentence stating what will end]. While it can appear in writing, it's also used in spoken declarations.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">健康のために、今日を限りにタバコをやめることにした。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">For my health, I've decided to quit smoking, starting today (i.e., today is the last day).</p>
    <p class="context">A personal declaration to stop a habit from a specific day onwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">あの歌手は、今回のコンサートを限りに引退することを発表した。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">That singer announced that they will retire after this current concert (i.e., this concert will be their last).</p>
    <p class="context">Reporting on a singer's decision to end their career after a final performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">誠に勝手ながら、当店は今月を限りに閉店させていただきます。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, but our store will be closing down at the end of this month.</p>
    <p class="context">A formal announcement about a store closure, indicating the final month of operation.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜をもって:</strong> Often used similarly to 「〜を限りに」 to indicate an end point, especially in formal announcements (e.g., 本日をもって閉店いたします - We will close as of today). 「〜をもって」 can sound slightly more formal or official than 「〜を限りに」 and is frequently used for events or official deadlines. While largely interchangeable in the context of ending something at a specific time, 「〜を限りに」 might carry a slightly stronger nuance of personal decision or marking the *very last* instance.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜まで:</strong> Indicates a duration "until" a certain point, but doesn't inherently carry the strong sense of declaration or finality of ending a continuous practice. Example: このセールは金曜日までです (This sale is on until Friday) - simply states the end date. Compare with: このセールは本日を限りに終了します (This sale ends today - implying it won't continue past today).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜で終わる:</strong> Simply states that something ends at/with something. Example: 会議は５時で終わる (The meeting ends at 5). It lacks the declarative force of 「〜を限りに」.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The word 「限り」(kagiri) means "limit" or "bounds." Using 「〜を限りに」 emphasizes that the specified time is the absolute limit, beyond which the activity will not continue. It's a relatively strong expression of cessation often used when making a significant decision public, like retirement or closing a long-running establishment. It can also be used hyperbolically, as in 「声を限りに叫んだ」 (shouted with all the strength/volume of one's voice - lit. 'making one's voice the limit'). However, the primary grammatical function discussed here relates to time limits.</p>
