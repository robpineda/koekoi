<h1>〜に足る</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>あるもの・あることが十分〜できる。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar point "〜に足る" (ni taru) translates to "worthy of ~," "sufficient to ~," or "deserving of ~." It indicates that something (a person, object, action, or situation) meets a certain standard, criteria, or level of quality, making it worth considering, trusting, evaluating, or performing the action mentioned. It often carries a nuance of judgment or evaluation, implying that the subject has inherent value or capability that makes it sufficient for a particular purpose or consideration. It is generally neutral to slightly formal in tone.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>"〜に足る" is more frequently used in written Japanese, formal speeches, articles, or evaluations rather than casual conversation. It typically follows a noun or the stem (連用形 - ren'yōkei) of a verb. The common structure is `Noun + に足る` or `Verb Stem + に足る`. It is used to express that something possesses the necessary qualities for an action or judgment.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼の提案は検討する<strong>に足る</strong>。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">His proposal is worthy of consideration.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Discussing various business proposals during a formal meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">この美術館はわざわざ訪れる<strong>に足る</strong>素晴らしいコレクションがある。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">This art museum has a wonderful collection that is worth making a special trip to visit.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Recommending a place known for its quality exhibits.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼は信頼<strong>に足る</strong>人物だと多くの人が考えている。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Many people consider him to be a person worthy of trust.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Assessing someone's character and reliability.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜だけの価値がある (dake no kachi ga aru):</strong> Meaning "has the value of doing ~." While similar, it perhaps focuses more directly on the inherent 'value' rather than 'sufficiency' for a purpose. Often interchangeable with 〜に足る.</p>
<p><strong>〜に値する (ni atai suru):</strong> Meaning "deserves ~" or "is worthy of ~." It is a very close synonym and used in similar formal contexts. 〜に足る might sometimes carry a slightly stronger sense of *sufficiency* or meeting a necessary condition, whereas 〜に値する emphasizes inherent worthiness or merit.</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This grammar point is often used with verbs related to evaluation, judgment, or trust, such as `信頼する` (to trust), `評価する` (to evaluate), `尊敬する` (to respect), `注目する` (to pay attention to), `検討する` (to consider), `議論する` (to discuss). The negative form, `〜に足らない` (ni taranai), meaning "not sufficient," "not worthy of," or "insignificant," is also commonly used.</p>
