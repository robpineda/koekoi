<h1>〜ともなると・〜ともなれば</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜くらい立場・程度が高くなると、そのような状態になる。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p><code>〜ともなると</code> and <code>〜ともなれば</code> indicate that when a certain condition is met, particularly one involving reaching a higher status, level, age, position, or degree of significance, a particular consequence, behavior, or state naturally follows or becomes expected. It implies crossing a threshold into a state where things are different or specific expectations apply.</p>
<p>The nuance is that reaching this level (<code>〜</code>) inherently brings about the subsequent situation. <code>〜ともなると</code> states this as a general fact or consequence ("When it becomes X..."). <code>〜ともなれば</code> often carries a slightly more conditional or hypothetical nuance ("If it should become X..." or "Once it gets to the point of being X..."). Both are generally used for significant levels or positions.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This grammar pattern is often used in more formal writing or speech to describe general truths, societal expectations, or common occurrences associated with reaching a particular stage or status. It typically follows a noun indicating the level, status, time, or position.</p>
<p>The common sentence structure is:</p>
<p><code>[Noun indicating level/status/time] + ともなると / ともなれば + [Consequence / Expected Situation / Natural Outcome]</code></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">社長<strong>ともなると</strong>、自分の時間を持つのは難しくなるものです。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">When one becomes company president, it naturally becomes difficult to have personal time.</p>
    <p class="context">Explaining a common consequence associated with achieving a high corporate position.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">子供も高校生<strong>ともなれば</strong>、自分の将来について真剣に考え始めるだろう。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Once children reach high school age, they will likely start thinking seriously about their future.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing an expected developmental milestone associated with reaching a certain age/grade level.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">普段は温厚な彼<strong>ともなると</strong>、家族のことになると人が変わったように怒ることがある。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Even for someone as usually gentle as him, when it comes to matters concerning his family, he sometimes gets angry as if he's a different person.</p>
    <p class="context">Highlighting how reaching a certain point (the topic becoming family-related) changes even a calm person's behavior.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜になると / 〜になれば:</strong> Simply means "when/if X becomes Y" or "when it becomes X time". It is more general and neutral. <code>〜ともなると/〜ともなれば</code> specifically emphasize the significance or high level of the condition (X) and the natural or expected consequences that follow *because* it has reached that level.</li>
    <li><strong>〜くらいになると:</strong> Similar in meaning ("when it reaches the level of X"), but <code>〜ともなると/〜ともなれば</code> often sounds more formal and perhaps emphasizes the associated responsibilities or inevitable changes more strongly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This structure conveys a sense of reaching a significant stage where certain realities or expectations naturally apply. It's often used to talk about roles (manager, parent, adult), age milestones (teenager, elderly), or specific circumstances (exam time, emergencies). <code>〜ともなれば</code> can sometimes imply a stronger conditionality or a hypothetical future state compared to the more declarative <code>〜ともなると</code>.</p>
