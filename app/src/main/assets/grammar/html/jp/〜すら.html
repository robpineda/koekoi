<h1>〜すら</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜という極端な例もそうなのだから、当然その他も同様だ。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>「〜すら (sura)」 means "even," but with a specific nuance. It highlights an extreme or unexpected example (X) to imply that if something is true for X, it's naturally or obviously true for other, less extreme cases. It often implies surprise, criticism, or emphasizes the extremity of a situation. It's generally considered more formal or literary than its common counterpart 「〜さえ (sae)」.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>「〜すら」 is typically used with nouns or noun phrases. It emphasizes that "even" this surprising or extreme case fits the description, thereby strengthening the point about the general situation. It is more common in written language or formal speech than in casual conversation. It can sometimes carry a negative connotation, highlighting something undesirable or difficult. For example, if even an expert can't do it (extreme case), then naturally, a beginner cannot.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼は疲れ果てて、指一本動かすことすらなかった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">He was so exhausted, he couldn't even move a single finger.</p>
    <p class="context">Emphasizing extreme exhaustion by highlighting the inability to perform even the minimal action of moving a finger.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">そんな簡単な漢字すら読めないとは、情けない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">It's pathetic that you can't even read such a simple kanji.</p>
    <p class="context">Criticizing someone's ability by pointing out their failure with an unexpectedly easy task (simple kanji).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">長年の親友ですら、彼の本当の気持ちを理解していなかった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Even his long-time best friend didn't understand his true feelings.</p>
    <p class="context">Highlighting the depth or hidden nature of his feelings by stating that even the person expected to understand him best, did not.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜さえ (sae):</strong> This also means "even" and is the most common equivalent. 「〜さえ」 is more versatile and used in both spoken and written Japanese. 「〜すら」 is generally considered more formal, literary, or slightly more emphatic in pointing out the extremity of the example. In many cases, they are interchangeable, but 「〜すら」 might sound stronger or more dated in casual contexts. Example: 「子供でさえ知っている」(Even a child knows) vs 「子供ですら知っている」(slightly more formal/emphatic).</p>
<p><strong>〜も (mo):</strong> While "mo" can mean "also" or "even," it usually lacks the specific nuance of highlighting an *extreme* example to make a broader point. 「〜すら」 and 「〜さえ」 focus on the minimum expectation or an unexpected case. Example: 「水も飲めない」(Can't drink water either / Can't even drink water - less emphasis on extremity) vs 「水すら飲めない」(Can't even drink water - emphasizes this basic inability).</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>「〜すら」 is often encountered in literature, formal essays, or news articles. While grammatically correct in speech, using it frequently in casual conversation might sound stiff or overly dramatic. It's useful for adding emphasis when describing surprising or extreme situations in more formal contexts.</p>
