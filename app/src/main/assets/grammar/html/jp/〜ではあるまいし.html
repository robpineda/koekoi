<h1>〜ではあるまいし</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜ならそのようなこともあるかもしれないが、〜ではないのだから。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>`〜ではあるまいし` (or its less formal contraction `〜じゃあるまいし`) is used to negate a premise or identity, often critically or reproachfully, implying that the subject is *not* the thing mentioned, and therefore should not act or be treated in a certain way associated with that thing. It translates roughly as "It's not as if...", "You're not X, so...", or "It isn't like...". It's often used to express disagreement, mild scolding, exasperation, or to point out inappropriate behavior or expectations by contrasting the subject with something they clearly are not.</p>
<p>The core feeling is often one of rebuke or pointing out a lack of common sense or appropriateness: "You're not [an X], so why are you acting like one / why should we expect Y?"</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This pattern typically follows a noun or noun phrase that represents the identity or condition the subject is being contrasted with. It's commonly used in spoken language, particularly in conversations involving criticism, advice, or expressing disagreement. The part of the sentence following `〜ではあるまいし` usually contains the main point – the criticism, the expected behavior, or the consequence that shouldn't apply.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Noun + ではあるまいし / じゃあるまいし</li>
</ul>
<p>It's frequently used when someone is acting childishly, irresponsibly, or inappropriately for their age or position.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">子供ではあるまいし、自分のことは自分できちんとしなさい。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">You're not a child, so take care of your own things properly.</p>
    <p class="context">Scolding someone (likely an adult or teenager) for being irresponsible or messy, implying they should act their age.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">神様じゃあるまいし、未来のことなんて誰にも分からないよ。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">It's not like I'm God; nobody knows what the future holds.</p>
    <p class="context">Responding to someone who is demanding predictions or certainty about the future, emphasizing human limitations.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">初めてのデートではあるまいし、そんなに緊張しなくてもいいだろう。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">It's not as if it's your first date, so you don't need to be that nervous.</p>
    <p class="context">Trying to reassure a friend who is overly anxious about a date, implying they have enough experience not to be so tense.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜わけではない:</strong> ("It's not the case that...") Denies an expected conclusion or implication based on a situation, but generally lacks the critical or scolding nuance of `〜ではあるまいし`. It's more explanatory.</li>
    <li><strong>〜ではない / 〜じゃない:</strong> Simple negation. Lacks the specific comparative and critical function of `〜ではあるまいし`.</li>
    <li><strong>〜らしくない:</strong> ("Unlike you...") Expresses that someone's behavior is out of character, but doesn't necessarily contrast them with a different type of person/thing like `〜ではあるまいし` does.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>`〜ではあるまいし` carries a relatively strong tone of criticism or admonishment, though it can sometimes be used humorously depending on the context and relationship between speakers. The `-まい` part is a negative presumptive auxiliary verb, often used in older or more formal styles, but in this set phrase, it's common even in relatively informal speech (especially as `〜じゃあるまいし`). Be mindful of the critical nuance when using it; it's typically directed at someone perceived to be acting inappropriately given who they are (or aren't).</p>
