<h1>〜はおろか</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜はもちろん、程度が違うほかのことにも同じことが言える。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar point `〜はおろか` (wa oroka) means "let alone X," "to say nothing of X," "never mind X," or "X is out of the question, and even Y..." It is used to present two items (X and Y) on a scale, emphasizing that even the lesser or more basic item (Y) is difficult, impossible, or lacking, implying that the greater or more expected item (X) is completely out of reach or obviously impossible/lacking as well. It typically highlights a negative situation or inability. X is the item considered more advanced, desirable, or expected, while Y is something considered simpler or more fundamental. The structure emphasizes the severity of the situation by pointing out the failure even at the level of Y.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>`〜はおろか` follows a noun (X). The sentence structure is typically "X はおろか Y も/さえ/まで [Negative Predicate]". The particle `は` is essential before `おろか`. The second part of the sentence (Y) often uses particles like `も` (also/even), `さえ` (even), or `まで` (even) to emphasize that *even* Y is not possible or not available. It's used in situations where one wants to strongly express lack, difficulty, or impossibility by highlighting failure at a more basic level than expected. It's often found in complaints, descriptions of hardship, or expressions of surprise at someone's lack of skill/knowledge.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼は敬語はおろか、日常会話もままならない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Let alone keigo (polite language), he can barely manage everyday conversation.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing someone's poor Japanese language skills, emphasizing that even basic conversation is difficult, let alone complex polite forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">怪我をして、歩くことはおろか、立つことさえできない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Having injured myself, let alone walk, I can't even stand up.</p>
    <p class="context">Explaining the severity of an injury – standing (Y) is impossible, so walking (X) is completely out of the question.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">うちの会社はボーナスはおろか、給料の支払いも遅れている。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Never mind a bonus, our company is even late paying salaries.</p>
    <p class="context">Complaining about a company's financial situation, highlighting that even the basic salary (Y) is delayed, making a bonus (X) unthinkable.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜はもちろん〜も (wa mochiron...mo):</strong> Means "X goes without saying, but also Y." This structure is used for *positive* additions. It states that X is obviously true/present, and adds that Y is *also* true/present. `〜はおろか` is used for *negative* situations, implying X is obviously *not* possible/present because even Y isn't.</li>
    <li><strong>〜どころか (dokoro ka):</strong> Can have two meanings: 1) "far from X, actually Y (opposite/different situation)" or 2) Similar to `〜はおろか`, meaning "let alone X, even Y...". In the second meaning, it's very close to `〜はおろか`, perhaps slightly more colloquial or emphatic in expressing the contrast or extreme situation. Often, `〜はおろか` feels a bit more standard for the "let alone" meaning in formal contexts.</li>
    <li><strong>〜だけでなく〜も (dake de naku...mo):</strong> Means "not only X, but also Y." This is a neutral addition and doesn't inherently carry the "scaling" nuance (from greater X to lesser Y) or the strong negative implication of `〜はおろか`.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>`〜はおろか` is a strong expression used to emphasize deprivation, lack of ability, or difficult circumstances. Using it effectively requires clearly establishing the scale between X (the higher/expected thing) and Y (the lower/basic thing). The negative predicate at the end of the sentence is crucial. It's more common in writing or slightly formal speech than in very casual chats, though its meaning is widely understood.</p>
