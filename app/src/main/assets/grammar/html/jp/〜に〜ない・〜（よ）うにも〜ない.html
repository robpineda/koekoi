<h1>〜に〜ない・〜（よ）うにも〜ない</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜したいけれど、何かの事情があってできない。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This grammar pattern expresses the frustration or inability to perform an action despite having the desire or intention to do so. It highlights a conflict between one's will and external circumstances or internal constraints that prevent the action.</p>
<p>The structure involves repeating the verb:
<ul>
    <li>`Verb (stem form) + に + Verb (potential negative form)`: e.g., 泣くに泣けない (naku ni nakenai - want to cry but can't cry). This emphasizes the inability to perform the action itself.</li>
    <li>`Verb (volitional form) + にも + Verb (potential negative form)`: e.g., 泣こうにも泣けない (nakou ni mo nakenai - want to cry / try to cry but can't cry). This version, using the volitional form (`-(よ)う`), often adds a stronger nuance of *attempting* to do the action but still being unable to.</li>
</ul>
The core meaning is "want to X, but cannot X" or "try to X, but cannot X," often implying a sense of being stuck, helpless, or constrained.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This pattern is used in both spoken and written Japanese, though the `〜(よ)うにも〜ない` form might feel slightly more emphatic or literary. It's commonly used to express personal dilemmas, frustrations, or situations where one feels powerless.</p>
<p>It frequently appears in narrative descriptions or when someone explains why they couldn't act in a certain way they desired. The repeated verb strongly emphasizes the specific action that is blocked.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">あまりにも突然の出来事で、悲しくて泣こうにも涙が出なかった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">It happened so suddenly that, although I was sad and wanted to cry, the tears just wouldn't come out.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing a state of shock where emotions cannot be physically expressed despite the desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">仕事が終わらず、帰りたくても帰るに帰れない状況だ。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">My work isn't finished, so it's a situation where even though I want to go home, I can't.</p>
    <p class="context">Explaining why someone cannot leave work due to unfinished tasks or obligations.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">歯が痛くて、食べようにも食べられない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">My tooth hurts so much that even if I try to eat, I can't.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing the inability to perform a basic action (eating) due to a physical constraint (pain).</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜したくてもできない (shitakutemo dekinai):</strong> Means "even if I want to do ~, I can't." This is very close in meaning and usage. `〜(よ)うにも〜ない` might carry a slightly stronger sense of frustration or the blocked attempt.</p>
<p><strong>〜わけにはいかない (wake ni wa ikanai):</strong> Means "cannot possibly ~" often due to social norms, obligations, or logical reasons. While it expresses inability, it focuses more on the reason (often external pressure or rules) rather than the internal conflict between desire and inability highlighted by `〜に〜ない`.</p>
<p><strong>〜ことができない (koto ga dekinai):</strong> Simple statement of inability ("cannot do ~"). It lacks the specific nuance of wanting to do the action but being prevented, which is central to `〜に〜ない`.</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This structure is quite expressive and useful for conveying a sense of dilemma or being trapped by circumstances. The repetition of the verb makes the point of blockage very clear.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the verb forms: the first verb is either the stem (masu-stem) or the volitional form, while the second verb is the potential negative form (e.g., 書く -> 書けない; 食べる -> 食べられない).</p>
