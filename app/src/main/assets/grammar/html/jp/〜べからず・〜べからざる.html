<h1>〜べからず・〜べからざる</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜するな。〜してはならないことだ。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This grammar point represents a strong prohibition ("must not do," "do not do") or describes something as forbidden or unacceptable. It is derived from classical Japanese and carries a very formal, authoritative, and often archaic tone.</p>
<p>There are two related forms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜べからず (bekarazu):</strong> Functions as a strong negative imperative, meaning "Must not do ~" or "Do not ~." It's often seen as a standalone sentence or phrase, typically in warnings or regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>〜べからざる (bekarazaru):</strong> Functions as an adjective modifying a noun, meaning "that which must not be done," "unacceptable," "unforgivable," or "improper." It describes the noun as being subject to prohibition or strong disapproval.</li>
</ul>
Both forms convey a much stronger sense of prohibition than modern equivalents like `〜てはいけない` (te wa ikenai). They often imply moral judgment or strict rules.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>These forms are rarely used in modern everyday conversation. Their usage is confined to specific contexts:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Signs and Public Notices:</strong> `〜べからず` is famously used on signs (e.g., 「芝生に入るべからず」 - Do not enter the lawn).</li>
    <li><strong>Formal Rules and Regulations:</strong> Found in older or very formal sets of rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Literature and Historical Texts:</strong> Used to reflect classical language or create a specific tone.</li>
    <li><strong>Rhetoric and Formal Speech:</strong> Sometimes used for stylistic effect to convey strong condemnation or authority.</li>
    <li><strong>Set Phrases:</strong> Some nouns are commonly modified by `〜べからざる` (e.g., `許すべからざる行為` - an unforgivable act).</li>
</ul>
The structure is: `Verb (dictionary form) + べからず` (Prohibition). `Verb (dictionary form) + べからざる + Noun` (Attribute). For `する` verbs: `すべからず / すべからざる`.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">（看板に）危険！ここに立ち入るべからず。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">(On a sign) Danger! Do not enter here.</p>
    <p class="context">A typical example of `〜べからず` used as a strong warning on a sign.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼のしたことは、人として許すべからざる行為だ。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">What he did is an act unforgivable for a human being.</p>
    <p class="context">Using `〜べからざる` to modify `行為` (act), expressing strong moral condemnation.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">古文書には「民は политику を論ずべからず」と記されていた。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">It was written in the old document, "The common people must not discuss politics."</p>
    <p class="context">Showing `〜べからず` used in a historical context to represent an old rule or law.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜てはいけない / 〜ではいけない (te wa ikenai / de wa ikenai):</strong> The standard modern Japanese way to express prohibition ("must not do"). It's far more common and less severe/formal than `〜べからず`.</p>
<p><strong>〜禁止 (kinshi):</strong> Means "prohibited" or "forbidden." Often used on signs (e.g., `立入禁止` - Entry Prohibited). It's a noun or suru-verb, whereas `〜べからず` is a verbal ending.</p>
<p><strong>〜な (na):</strong> The informal negative command ("Don't do ~"). It's casual and direct, the opposite of the formal and archaic `〜べからず`.</p>
<p><strong>〜まじき (majiki):</strong> Similar in formality and nuance, meaning "should not do / unbecoming of." However, `〜まじき` specifically relates inappropriate actions to a certain role, position, or moral standard and always modifies a noun, similar to `〜べからざる`. `〜べからず` is a direct prohibition.</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>Understanding `〜べからず` and `〜べからざる` is important for reading older texts, formal documents, or certain public signs in Japan. Using them in speech requires careful consideration of the context, as they sound very strong and potentially archaic.</p>
<p>The `べからざる` form attaches directly to the dictionary form of the verb and modifies the following noun, acting like an adjective (specifically, a pre-noun adjectival form in classical grammar).</p>
