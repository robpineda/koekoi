<h1>〜に至っては</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜という極端な例では、ある状態だ。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>「〜に至っては (ni itatte wa)」 means "when it comes to X (as a specific, often extreme or notable example)...". It is used to single out a particular subject from a group or context and make a comment specifically about it, often highlighting how it represents an extreme case compared to others mentioned or implied. It frequently carries a tone of surprise, criticism, exasperation, or emphasis regarding the state of that specific example.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This pattern is used to draw attention to a particular item (person, place, thing, subject) within a larger discussion, usually to contrast it or emphasize its specific condition. It often follows a noun. The structure is typically:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Noun + に至っては + [Comment / Observation]</strong></li>
</ul>
It is common in situations where one compares different elements and wants to focus on one particularly striking instance. While usable in speech, it's somewhat formal and more frequently encountered in writing or presentations where specific points are being highlighted or argued.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">他の社員は遅刻しても注意される程度だが、彼に至っては、無断欠勤を繰り返している。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Other employees just get warned even if they're late, but when it comes to him, he repeatedly skips work without notice.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Comparing the behavior of employees, highlighting one individual's actions as particularly problematic.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">景気は全体的に悪いが、地方の小企業に至っては、倒産が相次いでいる。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">The economy is bad overall, but when it comes to small businesses in rural areas, bankruptcies are occurring one after another.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Discussing economic conditions, focusing on the particularly dire situation of a specific segment.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">兄はスポーツ万能、姉は成績優秀。末っ子の私に至っては、特に取り柄もない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">My older brother is great at sports, my older sister has excellent grades. As for me, the youngest, I have no particular talents.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Comparing siblings, using the structure somewhat self-deprecatingly to highlight one's own perceived lack of special qualities.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜は / 〜が (Topic Markers):</strong> These are general topic markers. 「〜に至っては」 specifically singles out the topic as a noteworthy or extreme case within a context, adding emphasis that simple 「は」 or 「が」 lack.</li>
    <li><strong>〜について言えば (ni tsuite ieba):</strong> "Speaking of X..." This is a more neutral way to shift focus to a topic. 「〜に至っては」 often carries a stronger emotional tone (surprise, criticism, etc.) and implies comparison or extremity.</li>
    <li><strong>〜は言うまでもなく (wa iu made mo naku):</strong> "Not to mention X / Needless to say about X". Used when X is an obvious example, often followed by highlighting something less obvious. 「〜に至っては」 focuses on X itself as the extreme or specific case requiring comment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The main function of 「〜に至っては」 is to spotlight a specific case, often suggesting it's the worst, best, most surprising, or most typical example of the point being made. The nuance heavily depends on the context and the statement that follows. It's a way to say, "And if we look specifically at *this* example, the situation is..."</p>
