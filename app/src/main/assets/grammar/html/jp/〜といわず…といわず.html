<h1>〜といわず…といわず</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜も…も区別なく全部。あらゆる所。いつも、同じようだ。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar pattern 「Aといわず Bといわず」 emphasizes the totality or pervasiveness of something by listing two examples (A and B) and implying that the condition applies not just to A and B, but to *everything* of that kind or category, without distinction. It translates roughly as "not just A, not just B, but..." or "both A and B, and everything else like them...". It strongly suggests that the described state or action covers the entire range, area, or time period represented by the examples. It often implies "everywhere," "all over," "completely," or "constantly."</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This structure is used to stress that something applies comprehensively across different instances or parts of a whole. A and B are typically nouns representing related items, places, times, or body parts. The structure is: `Noun A + といわず + Noun B + といわず, [Main Clause describing the pervasive state/action]`. It's found in both written and spoken language and serves to emphasize the extent or scope of the main clause's statement. It often describes a state that covers an entire surface, body, period, etc.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼は、顔といわず手といわず、泥だらけになって遊んでいた。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">He was playing, covered in mud not just on his face, not just on his hands, but all over.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing a child who got completely dirty while playing.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">店の壁といわず天井といわず、有名な俳優のサインで埋め尽くされていた。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Not just the walls, not just the ceiling – the shop was completely filled with famous actors' autographs.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing a shop thoroughly decorated with autographs.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">休みの日といわず、仕事の後といわず、彼はいつもジムに通っている。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Not just on days off, not just after work – he goes to the gym all the time (constantly).</p>
    <p class="context">Emphasizing someone's dedication to going to the gym, irrespective of the day or time.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜だけでなく〜も / 〜はもちろん〜も:</strong> Means "not only A but also B." Focuses on adding B, while 「〜といわず〜といわず」 emphasizes the *totality* represented by A and B. Example: 「壁だけでなく天井にもサインがある。」 (There are autographs not only on the walls but also on the ceiling.) - Less emphasis on *everywhere*. <br>
    <strong>〜も〜も:</strong> Simply lists two items. Doesn't strongly convey the sense of "all over" or "without distinction" like 「〜といわず〜といわず」. Example: 「顔も手も泥だらけだ。」 (His face and hands are covered in mud.)<br>
    <strong>〜から〜まで:</strong> Indicates a range from a starting point to an ending point (e.g., 「頭からつま先まで」 - from head to toe). 「〜といわず〜といわず」 lists examples to imply comprehensive coverage without necessarily defining strict boundaries.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This pattern is powerful for emphasizing completeness or lack of exception. The key nuance is "without making a distinction between A and B (and everything else like them)." It's often used to describe physical states (like being covered in something) or consistent actions over time. Choose examples (A and B) that effectively represent the whole category you want to encompass (e.g., parts of the body, different times, different locations).</p>
