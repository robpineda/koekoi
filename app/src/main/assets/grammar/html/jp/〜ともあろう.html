<h1>〜ともあろう</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>立派な能力や責任がある〜なのに、それにふさわしくないことをする。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p><code>〜ともあろう</code> is an expression used to express strong surprise, criticism, disappointment, or disbelief that someone holding a high status, position, respectable role, or possessing significant abilities would do something unfitting, inappropriate, or unexpected for that position. It highlights a stark contrast between the person's (or entity's) expected standing/behavior and their actual actions.</p>
<p>The core nuance is one of reproach: "Someone like X, who should know better or act better due to their position/status, did *this* (unfitting thing)." It implies a violation of expectations associated with the role or status mentioned before <code>ともあろう</code>. It is often followed by expressions of condemnation or disbelief (e.g., 〜とは信じられない, 〜なんて許せない).</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This grammar point is used in relatively formal contexts, such as critical commentary, news reporting, formal speeches, or serious discussions, often when condemning perceived misconduct or inappropriate behavior by figures of authority or respect.</p>
<p>The structure typically is:</p>
<p><code>[Noun/Person of high standing/respect] + ともあろう + [者/人/ものが (optional particle/noun)] + [Unexpected / Inappropriate action or statement]</code></p>
<p>The particle/noun like <code>者 (もの)</code> or <code>人 (ひと)</code> emphasizes the person, while <code>ものが</code> adds a stronger tone of disbelief or criticism.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">教師<strong>ともあろう</strong>者が、生徒に対して暴力を振るうなど、言語道断だ。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">For someone who is a teacher to commit violence against a student is outrageous.</p>
    <p class="context">Expressing strong condemnation of a teacher's unacceptable behavior, highlighting the contradiction with their professional role.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">経験豊富なベテラン<strong>ともあろう</strong>あなたが、こんな初歩的なミスをするとは思いませんでした。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">I didn't expect that you, an experienced veteran, would make such a basic mistake.</p>
    <p class="context">Expressing surprise and slight criticism towards an experienced person for making an elementary error.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">裁判官<strong>ともあろう</strong>ものが、賄賂を受け取っていたとは、司法への信頼を揺るがす事件だ。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">For someone who is a judge, of all people, to accept bribes is an incident that shakes trust in the judiciary.</p>
    <p class="context">Expressing shock and dismay about corruption involving a person in a position requiring utmost integrity.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜なのに:</strong> Means "despite being X / even though X". It indicates a general contrast but lacks the strong sense of criticism and violated expectations inherent in <code>〜ともあろう</code>. <code>〜ともあろう</code> specifically links the inappropriateness of the action to the high status/role of the subject.</li>
    <li><strong>〜たるもの（は）:</strong> (See next grammar point) Describes the *expected* duties or behavior of someone in a certain position. <code>〜ともあろう</code> focuses on the *failure* to meet those expectations by doing something unfitting. One is prescriptive (should be), the other is critical (shouldn't have).</li>
    <li><strong>〜にしては:</strong> Means "for being X..." and usually expresses surprise that something is better or worse than expected given X, but without the strong moral judgment or focus on responsibility seen in <code>〜ともあろう</code>. (e.g., 子供にしてはよくできた - "Well done for a child").</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p><code>〜ともあろう</code> carries a significant weight of judgment and is used when pointing out behavior seen as falling short of the standards demanded by a particular role or status, especially positions of trust or authority. It implies that the person should have acted differently precisely *because* of who they are or the position they hold. It's a formal and somewhat accusatory expression.</p>
