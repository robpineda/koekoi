<h1>〜に堪える、〜に堪えない</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜するだけの価値がある、ひどい状態で〜が我慢できない・〜するだけの価値がない。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This grammar point has two contrasting forms based on the verb 堪える (taeru - to bear, endure, stand):</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜に堪える (ni taeru):</strong> Means "worthy of ~," "can stand/withstand ~," or "bearable." It implies that something possesses sufficient quality, interest, or value to be experienced, viewed, listened to, or considered. It suggests it meets a minimum standard for appreciation or endurance.</li>
    <li><strong>〜に堪えない (ni taenai):</strong> Means "unbearable," "cannot stand ~," "not worth ~," or "too ~ to bear." It indicates that something is of such poor quality, so unpleasant, gruesome, or emotionally overwhelming that it cannot be endured or is not worth experiencing. It often conveys strong negative judgment or revulsion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nuance depends heavily on the positive or negative form. The positive suggests meeting a threshold of worthiness, while the negative implies falling far below it or being actively unbearable.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>Both forms are used in written and spoken Japanese, particularly in contexts of evaluation (art, music, literature, performance, situations, behavior). `〜に堪えない` is particularly strong and emphatic. They usually follow a noun or the stem (連用形 - ren'yōkei) of a verb, typically indicating an action like seeing (見る), listening (聞く), or reading (読む). The structure is `Noun / Verb Stem + に堪える / に堪えない`.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼のヴァイオリン演奏は、聴く<strong>に堪える</strong>ものだった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">His violin performance was worth listening to.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Evaluating a musical performance, indicating it met a decent standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">その映画はあまりに拙劣で、鑑賞<strong>に堪えなかった</strong>。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">That movie was so poorly made, it wasn't worth watching (unbearable to watch).</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Strongly criticizing a low-quality film.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">事故現場の光景は、あまりにも悲惨で見る<strong>に堪えなかった</strong>。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">The scene at the accident site was so tragic it was unbearable to look at.</p>
    <p class="context">Context: Describing a horrific or gruesome scene that evokes strong negative feelings.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜に足る (ni taru):</strong> (Positive form comparison) Focuses on sufficiency or meeting a standard for consideration. `〜に堪える` emphasizes withstanding scrutiny or being bearable/worthwhile to *experience* directly (seeing, hearing, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>〜（する）価値がある (suru kachi ga aru):</strong> A more direct expression of value ("has the value of doing ~"). `〜に堪える` often implies passing a certain threshold of acceptability or endurance.</p>
<p><strong>〜がまんできない (gaman dekinai):</strong> (Negative form comparison) Means "cannot endure/stand," often due to annoyance, pain, or frustration. `〜に堪えない` is often used specifically for low quality of artistic works, performances, or for unbearable sights/sounds due to their unpleasant or gruesome nature.</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The core meaning comes from the verb `堪える` (taeru). Pay close attention to whether the positive (`堪える`) or negative (`堪えない`) form is used, as they convey opposite meanings. The negative form `〜に堪えない` is particularly strong and should be used carefully as it expresses significant displeasure or revulsion.</p>
