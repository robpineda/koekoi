<h1>〜ならいざしらず</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜ならそうかもしれないが、全く違う状況なのだから結果も違う。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>「〜ならいざしらず」(nara iza shirazu) is an expression meaning "If it were ~, that might be understandable, but..." or "I wouldn't know about the case of ~, but...". It's used to contrast a hypothetical or extreme situation (~) with the actual, different situation being discussed. The speaker concedes that a certain outcome might apply to the hypothetical case (~) but strongly implies that it doesn't apply to the current, different reality. It often expresses surprise, criticism, or disagreement about applying the standards or expectations of the hypothetical case (~) to the current one. The core feeling is "That's a different story entirely."</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This expression is typically used in conversational settings, debates, or explanations where the speaker wants to dismiss a comparison or excuse. It often precedes a statement emphasizing the difference of the actual situation and why the expected outcome (based on the hypothetical '~') is unreasonable or incorrect. It attaches to a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase representing the hypothetical or exceptional case. It carries a slightly emphatic or argumentative tone. The structure is `Hypothetical Case (Noun/Phrase) + ならいざしらず, [Actual Situation/Different Outcome]`. </p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">子供ならいざしらず、大人がそんな言い訳をするのは見苦しい。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">If it were a child, maybe, but it's unsightly for an adult to make such excuses.</p>
    <p class="context">Criticizing an adult's behavior by contrasting it with what might be excusable for a child.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">１０年前ならいざしらず、今時そのデザインは古すぎるよ。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Maybe 10 years ago, but that design is far too old-fashioned nowadays.</p>
    <p class="context">Commenting on a design, dismissing its past relevance by emphasizing current standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">経験豊富なプロならいざしらず、初心者がいきなりそんな難しい仕事は無理だろう。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">I could understand if it were an experienced pro, but it's probably impossible for a beginner to suddenly do such difficult work.</p>
    <p class="context">Expressing doubt about a beginner's ability to handle a task by contrasting them with a skilled professional.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜はともかく (wa tomokaku):</strong> Means "setting ~ aside," "never mind ~," or "apart from ~." It's used to temporarily ignore one topic (~) to focus on another, more important one. While it sets something aside, 「〜ならいざしらず」 specifically uses the hypothetical case (~) to contrast with and often criticize or invalidate the current situation or argument. 「〜はともかく」 is more about prioritizing topics.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜ならまだしも (nara mada shimo):</strong> Means "If it were just ~, it might be acceptable/better, but...". It's very similar to 「〜ならいざしらず」 in contrasting a hypothetical (and often more acceptable) situation with a worse reality. 「ならまだしも」 might imply a gradation (A is bad, but B is worse), while 「ならいざしらず」 often emphasizes a complete difference in category or applicability ("That's a completely different case"). They are often interchangeable.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This expression is a way to strongly delineate between different cases or standards. It's useful for refuting an argument, excuse, or comparison that the speaker finds inappropriate. The "いざしらず" part literally means "now, I don't know," conveying the sense of "I can't speak for that other situation, but for *this* one...". It adds a definitive tone to the contrast being made. Be mindful that it can sound quite direct or critical.</p>
