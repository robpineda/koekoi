<h1>〜をよそに</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜は自分とは無関係であるかのように、少しも気にしないで行動する。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>「〜をよそに」(o yoso ni) means "ignoring ~," "paying no attention to ~," "disregarding ~," or "despite ~ (in the background)." It indicates that someone carries out an action without paying any mind to or being affected by a certain surrounding situation, expectation, concern, or opinion (~), often one that they arguably *should* be paying attention to. It implies a sense of detachment or indifference, which can sometimes carry a negative nuance of being inconsiderate or oblivious, but can also imply independence or focus depending on the context. The key feeling is that the subject acts as if the surrounding factor is irrelevant to them.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This expression is often used to describe situations where someone acts contrary to expectations, concerns, or the general mood. It typically follows a noun phrase representing the disregarded factor (e.g., worries, criticism, rules, surrounding activity). Common preceding nouns include 心配 (shinpai - worry), 期待 (kitai - expectation), 反対 (hantai - opposition), 忠告 (chuukoku - advice), 規則 (kisoku - rules), or descriptions of a situation (e.g., 騒ぎ - commotion). It is used more often in writing or slightly formal speech than in casual conversation. The structure is `Disregarded Factor (Noun) + をよそに + [Action taken]`. </p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">家族の心配をよそに、彼は危険な山に一人で登っていった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Ignoring his family's worries, he went to climb the dangerous mountain alone.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing someone acting against the concerns of their loved ones, highlighting their independent (or reckless) action.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">住民たちの抗議行動をよそに、ダムの建設工事は続けられた。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Disregarding the residents' protests, the dam construction work continued.</p>
    <p class="context">Reporting on a situation where authorities or a company proceed with a plan despite public opposition.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">周りの騒ぎをよそに、子供たちは遊びに夢中だった。</p>

    <p class="context">Describing children oblivious to surrounding distractions due to intense focus on their activity.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜を無視して (o mushi shite):</strong> Means "ignoring ~." This is a very direct and often more negative way to say someone disregarded something. 「〜をよそに」 can sometimes be slightly softer or imply obliviousness rather than deliberate ignoring, though it can also carry criticism.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜にもかかわらず (ni mo kakawarazu):</strong> Means "despite ~" or "in spite of ~." This is a broader contrastive marker. 「〜をよそに」 specifically highlights the *lack of attention* or *indifference* towards the factor, whereas 「〜にもかかわらず」 simply states a contrast. One can act *despite* something while still acknowledging it; 「〜をよそに」 implies the factor is treated as irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜を気にせずに (o ki ni sezu ni):</strong> Means "without worrying about ~" or "without paying mind to ~." This is very close in meaning and often interchangeable. 「〜をよそに」 might carry a slightly stronger nuance of acting as if something belongs to "another world" (yoso = elsewhere, other place), emphasizing the detachment.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The nuance of 「〜をよそに」 can depend heavily on context. It can describe admirable independence (e.g., ignoring criticism to follow one's path) or blameworthy negligence (e.g., ignoring warnings). The core idea is the psychological distance the subject creates between themselves and the factor mentioned. It often highlights a disconnect between the subject's actions and the surrounding context or expectations.</p>
