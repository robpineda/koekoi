<h1>〜なり</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜という動作にすぐ連続して次のことをする。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar point "〜なり" (nari) expresses that someone does something *immediately* after performing the first action. A key feature of 〜なり is that it strongly implies the **same subject** performs both the first and the second action. Furthermore, the second action is often something unexpected, excessive, or unusual given the first action. It emphasizes the unbroken, immediate transition from the first verb's action to the second, often with a nuance of impulsiveness or lack of pause.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This structure is often found in narratives (novels, stories) to describe a character's quick, sometimes surprising, subsequent action. It's less common in everyday conversation and leans towards written or descriptive language. It follows the dictionary form of a verb. The second clause describes the action performed by the same subject immediately following the first.</p>
<p>Structure: Verb (Dictionary Form) + なり + Second Clause (Same Subject)</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">彼はコーヒーを飲むなり、カップを床に投げつけた。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">As soon as he drank the coffee, he threw the cup onto the floor.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing a sudden, unexpected, and possibly violent action immediately following a normal one.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">息子は家に帰るなり、かばんも置かずに遊びに行ってしまった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">As soon as my son got home, he went out to play without even putting down his bag.</p>
    <p class="context">Highlighting the child's immediate action and eagerness to play, perhaps seen as slightly irresponsible or hasty.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">部長は電話を切るなり、部屋を出ていってしまった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">The moment the manager hung up the phone, he stormed out of the room.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing a manager's abrupt departure immediately after a phone call, implying something significant or upsetting was discussed.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜が早いか / 〜や否や:</strong> These also mean "as soon as" but do not strictly require the same subject for both clauses. They focus more on the immediate sequence of events rather than the nature (unexpected, excessive) of the second action performed by the same subject.
    <br>
    <strong>〜たとたん(に):</strong> Indicates an immediate consequence, often unexpected, but doesn't necessarily imply the same subject or the slightly unusual nature of the second action that 〜なり often does. The second event in 〜たとたん is frequently an involuntary reaction or external happening.
    <br>
    <strong>〜次第 (shidai):</strong> Used after the stem of a verb (e.g., 帰り次第 - kaeri shidai - as soon as I return), it also means "as soon as." However, 〜次第 is often used for planned or expected future actions (often in business contexts), whereas 〜なり describes past actions that happened immediately and often unexpectedly.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>The key takeaway for 〜なり is the combination of **immediacy** and the **same subject** performing a potentially **unexpected or notable** second action. It adds a slightly dramatic or descriptive flair compared to simpler conjunctions. Because of the nuance of unexpectedness, it's often used to describe actions that are somewhat out of the ordinary.</p>
