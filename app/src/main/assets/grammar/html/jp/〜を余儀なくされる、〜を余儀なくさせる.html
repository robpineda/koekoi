<h1>〜を余儀なくされる、〜を余儀なくさせる</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>ある事情によりどうしても〜しなければならなくなる、ある事情が〜という状況に追い込む。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>This pair of expressions describes situations where someone is forced into an action or state by unavoidable external circumstances. They carry a strong nuance of regret or undesirability regarding the forced situation.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>〜を余儀なくされる (o yoginaku sareru) [Passive]:</strong> "To be forced to (do/undergo)...", "To have no choice but to..." The subject of the sentence is the one being compelled by external factors (e.g., bad weather, illness, economic downturn) to accept an often unwanted situation or action (e.g., cancellation, resignation, change of plans).</li>
    <li><strong>〜を余儀なくさせる (o yoginaku saseru) [Causative]:</strong> "To force (someone) to...", "To compel..." The subject of the sentence is the external factor or circumstance that forces the situation upon someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are very formal expressions, typically used for significant, often negative, changes or decisions brought about by powerful external pressures.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>These expressions are primarily used in formal written language, such as news reports, official announcements, academic papers, and historical accounts. They are suitable for explaining why certain actions (often cancellations, delays, changes in strategy, resignations, evacuations) became unavoidable due to circumstances beyond anyone's control.</p>
<p>The structure usually involves: **Noun (representing the forced action/state) + を余儀なくされる / を余儀なくさせた**</p>
<p>Common nouns include: 中止 (chuushi - cancellation), 変更 (henkou - change), 延期 (enki - postponement), 撤退 (tettai - withdrawal), 辞任 (jinin - resignation), 避難 (hinan - evacuation), 中退 (chuutai - dropping out).</p>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p><strong>〜なければならない / 〜ないといけない:</strong> Express general obligation ("must," "have to"). They lack the strong nuance of being *forced by unavoidable, external, often negative circumstances* that is central to 「〜を余儀なくされる/させる」.</p>
<p><strong>〜ないではすまない / 〜ずにはすまない:</strong> Indicate unavoidability due to social norms or immediate circumstances ("cannot avoid doing"). Usually refers to specific actions needed to resolve a situation. 「〜を余儀なくされる」 often relates to larger, more impactful life changes or decisions forced by significant events.</p>
<p><strong>〜せざるを得ない (sezaru o enai):</strong> Means "cannot avoid doing," "have no choice but to do." It's very similar in meaning to 「〜を余儀なくされる」 and also quite formal. A key difference is structure: 「〜せざるを得ない」 attaches to a verb stem (e.g., 中止せざるを得ない - have no choice but to cancel), while 「〜を余儀なくされる」 typically follows a noun (中止を余儀なくされる - to be forced into cancellation).</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>These are very formal expressions, almost exclusively used in written contexts or highly formal announcements. They emphasize the powerlessness of the individual or entity in the face of overwhelming external forces (natural disasters, economic conditions, unavoidable circumstances). Understanding the passive (`される` - the one being forced) vs. causative (`させる` - the forcing agent) is key to using them correctly.</p>
