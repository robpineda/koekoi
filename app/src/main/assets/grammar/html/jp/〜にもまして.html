<h1>〜にもまして</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>通常のこと・以前のことよりも、ほかのこと・現在のことの方が程度が上た。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar point "〜にもまして" (ni mo mashite) means "even more than...", "above and beyond...", or "surpassing even...". It is used to emphasize that the degree, intensity, or importance of something (mentioned after "にもまして") exceeds that of something else (mentioned before "にもまして"), which is often a previous state, a standard, or another comparable item. It adds a strong emphasis, indicating that the level is higher than expected or particularly noteworthy. This expression generally carries a formal or literary tone (JLPT N2/N1 level).</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This pattern is often used to highlight a significant increase, a deeper feeling, or a greater importance compared to a baseline. It's frequently found in formal speeches, written essays, literature, or when expressing strong personal feelings or convictions. The typical structure is: Noun + にもまして or [Interrogative word (like 何、誰、いつ) + にもまして].</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">以前にもまして、彼は仕事に情熱を注いでいる。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Even more than before, he is pouring passion into his work.</p>
    <p class="context">Describing someone whose dedication to work has increased compared to the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">受賞したことにもまして、長年の努力が認められたことが彼女にとっては大きな喜びだった。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Even more than receiving the award, having her many years of effort recognized was a great joy for her.</p>
    <p class="context">Explaining that the recognition felt even more significant than the award itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">何にもまして、家族の健康が一番大切だと考えています。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">I believe that, above all else (more than anything), my family's health is the most important thing.</p>
    <p class="context">Expressing a strong conviction about priorities, emphasizing health over everything else.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜以上に (ijou ni):</strong> Means "more than..." and is very similar in meaning. "〜にもまして" might carry a slightly stronger emotional emphasis or literary nuance compared to the more generally applicable "〜以上に".<br>
    <strong>さらに (sara ni):</strong> Means "furthermore", "additionally", or "even more". While it can indicate an increase in degree, it's often used more broadly to add information, whereas "〜にもまして" specifically emphasizes surpassing a stated or implied baseline.<br>
    <strong>〜より (yori):</strong> The basic particle for comparison ("than"). "〜にもまして" provides a much stronger emphasis and formality than a simple "〜より".
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>Due to its emphatic and somewhat formal nature, "〜にもまして" is less common in casual, everyday spoken Japanese. It is effective when you want to strongly stress that something exceeds a previous level or standard, often conveying a sense of admiration, heightened emotion, or strong belief. When used with interrogative words like 何 (nani), 誰 (dare), いつ (itsu), it forms set phrases like 何にもまして (more than anything), 誰にもまして (more than anyone), いつにもまして (more than ever).</p>
