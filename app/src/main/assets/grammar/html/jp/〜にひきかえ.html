<h1>〜にひきかえ</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜とは大きく違って・〜とは反対に、そのことはいい・悪い。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The grammar point "〜にひきかえ" (ni hikikae) is used to express a strong contrast between two subjects, situations, or time periods. It translates roughly to "in sharp contrast to...", "unlike...", or "whereas...". It emphasizes a significant difference, often highlighting that the second element is notably positive or negative compared to the first. This pattern carries a stronger sense of contrast than simpler comparative structures and often implies a subjective judgment or evaluation by the speaker. It is generally used in more formal written or spoken Japanese (around JLPT N2/N1 level).</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>This grammar point is typically used when comparing two distinct entities (people, places, events, etc.) and drawing attention to their opposing characteristics or outcomes. It's common in essays, reports, formal speeches, or narratives where a clear contrast needs to be established. The structure is usually: Noun + にひきかえ, or sometimes [Clause + の] + にひきかえ, followed by the contrasting statement.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">兄が非常に社交的なのにひきかえ、弟は内気で人見知りだ。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">In sharp contrast to the older brother being very sociable, the younger brother is shy and reserved around strangers.</p>
    <p class="context">Comparing the distinct personalities of two brothers.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">昨年の記録的な猛暑にひきかえ、今年は冷夏で過ごしやすい。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Unlike last year's record-breaking heatwave, this year is a cool summer and easy to get through.</p>
    <p class="context">Contrasting the weather conditions of two consecutive years, highlighting the positive aspect of the current year.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">活気のある都市部にひきかえ、私の故郷の村は静かで時間がゆっくり流れている。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Whereas the urban areas are bustling with energy, my hometown village is quiet and time flows slowly.</p>
    <p class="context">Comparing the atmosphere of a city versus a rural village.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜に対して (ni taishite):</strong> While also indicating contrast, "〜に対して" can be more neutral and objective. It simply presents two differing facts or aspects, whereas "〜にひきかえ" emphasizes the *degree* of difference and often carries an implicit evaluation (good/bad, surprising). <br>
    <strong>〜一方（で）(ippou (de)):</strong> Can show contrast ("on the other hand"), but can also indicate two parallel aspects or trends occurring simultaneously. "〜にひきかえ" focuses solely on the sharp contrast between two separate subjects. <br>
    <strong>〜反面 (hanmen):</strong> Used to describe two contrasting sides *of the same subject* (e.g., "This medicine is effective, but on the other hand, it has side effects"). "〜にひきかえ" compares two *different* subjects.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This structure is more common in written Japanese or formal presentations than in everyday casual conversation. Using "〜にひきかえ" implies that the difference between the two items being compared is significant and noteworthy. Avoid using it for minor or trivial differences. The evaluative aspect (good/bad) is usually conveyed by the content of the second clause rather than being inherent in the grammar itself, but the grammar draws strong attention to that evaluation.</p>
