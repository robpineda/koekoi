<h1>〜いかんだ</h1>

<h2>Explanation in Original Language</h2>
<p>〜がどうであるかによって事態が変わる・事態が決まる。</p>

<h2>Meaning and Nuances</h2>
<p>The expression 「〜いかんだ」(ikanda) means "depending on ~" or "based on ~". It indicates that the outcome, decision, or subsequent situation is determined solely by the factor specified before 「いかんだ」. It emphasizes that this preceding factor is the crucial variable that dictates what happens next. This structure often carries a slightly formal or written tone and is used when the determining factor is somewhat uncertain or variable at the time of speaking.</p>

<h2>Usage in Context</h2>
<p>「〜いかんだ」 is typically used in more formal settings, written reports, official announcements, or serious discussions rather than casual conversation. It follows a noun or a noun phrase that represents the determining condition or factor. The sentence usually concludes by stating the consequence or the dependency. The Kanji form 「〜如何だ」 is also common and reinforces the formal nuance.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">検査の結果いかんだでは、入院が必要になるかもしれない。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Depending on the results of the examination, hospitalization might become necessary.</p>
    <p class="context">A doctor explaining potential outcomes to a patient after a medical test.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">明日の天気いかんだで、イベントを中止するかどうかを決定します。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">We will decide whether to cancel the event depending on tomorrow's weather.</p>
    <p class="context">An official announcement regarding an outdoor event contingent on weather conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
    <p class="original-sentence">支援の内容いかんだが、被災地の復興には時間がかかるだろう。</p>
    <p class="en-translation">Depending on the content of the support, the recovery of the disaster-stricken area will likely take time.</p>
    <p class="context">Discussing the timeline for recovery efforts, highlighting the importance of the type and amount of aid.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparison to Similar Structures</h2>
<p>
    <strong>〜次第だ (shidai da):</strong> Very similar in meaning ("depending on"). Often interchangeable with 「いかんだ」, especially in formal or business contexts. 「次第だ」 might feel slightly more common in spoken formal Japanese, while 「いかんだ」 can sometimes sound a bit more written or literary.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜によって (ni yotte):</strong> Has a broader range of meanings, including "depending on," "according to," "due to," or "by means of." While it can express dependency, 「いかんだ」 specifically focuses on a condition determining an outcome. 「〜によって」 can also express cause or method.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>〜（か）どうかによる ((ka) douka ni yoru):</strong> More explicit, meaning "depends on whether or not ~." It's less concise than 「いかんだ」 but clearly expresses dependency on a binary outcome or state.
</p>

<h2>Cultural and Practical Notes</h2>
<p>This grammar point emphasizes contingency. It highlights that a future situation is not fixed but relies on a specific factor's state or outcome. Be aware of its formality; using it in very casual conversation might sound slightly stiff or overly dramatic. It's often associated with situations where the outcome has significant consequences.</p>
